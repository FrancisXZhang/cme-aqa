## Overview  

Vision-based **action quality assessment (AQA)** presents a promising solution for creating a more flexible action measurement tool in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** physical therapy training. Current automatic AQA frameworks for rehabilitation typically focus on a single view using skeletal data, which proves inefficient for TCM physical therapy techniques such as acupuncture or *tui na*. These techniques often involve significant self-occlusion of the hands and complex hand-object interactions.

To address these limitations, we propose the **Cross-View Multimodality Enhanced AQA (CME-AQA)** framework to improve action quality assessment in TCM physical therapy training. Our framework is designed to mitigate self-occlusion issues and enhance the understanding of environmental contexts. Specifically, our approach integrates view translation for pose and visual modality features across different viewpoints. To evaluate our method, we assembled a dataset named **TCM-AQA61**, which includes first-person and third-person videos of 61 subjects performing acupuncture and Chinese massage. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across most metrics, with **over 30% higher accuracy and F1 scores** in key rating tasks such as *Needle Depth* and *Quick Needle Movements*.  

Overall, the **CME-AQA** framework significantly enhances the precision of action quality assessment in TCM training by addressing challenges related to self-occlusion and limited environmental awareness.
